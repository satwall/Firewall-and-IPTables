# Firewall-and-IPTables
A few assignments regarding IPTables and Firewalls at BCIT. 

Assignment 1 was my first introduction to Firewall and IPTables, at the time I did not know any BASH, so I left the script I would input into the terminal I made in the documentation. 

For Assignment 2 was a more complex version, where I did more tests. Both internal.sh and firewall.sh are relevant for this assignment.
